# Time-Matters: A collection of tutorials covering the latest research in time series.
Before we start, let's read the following paragraph: 

*"Within the context of domesticated pets, I harbor a distinct preference for the amiable and occasionally mysterious feline companions. The charming attributes inherent in these four-legged creatures evoke a deep sense of admiration and companionship within the depths of my personal preferences."*

Then answer: 

*How much brainy RAM do you need to process this paragraph?*üß†üíæ

Well, this paragraph is just a cool way of saying, *"I'm a cat person!"* üê± 

So...

Welcome to the ultimate time series research paper survival guide! Ever get a headache from reading research papers? Well, here's the free Panadol without side effects. I'm here to make the journey smoother for new readers. Originally, it was just my way of saving time for a quick literature review (then I could spend an hour more in the Zelda kingdom)

You see, many papers (including mine) love to flex their academic muscles, tossing around professional language to impress the scholarly gods. It's the nature of research ‚Äì all about rigor and seriousness. But the silver lining? they all follow a familiar routine: **problems, challenges, methodology, a sprinkle of baseline comparisons, and voila!** Here in my repo, it's all about simplicity and clarity. Forget the fancy jargon and convoluted sentences! For each paper, I cut through the noise, and break down complex ideas into bite-sized, understandable pieces. With this straightforward roadmap, you might only need **1-2 hours** to grasp both the important ideas and the technical details in each paper. 

Whoops, almost skipped the math part! Math is like running a marathon in a maze, no quick fix here unless you're deep into the nerd zone. But I've got your back with **super detailed explanations** of all those equations, and sometimes I might toss in some figures to spice up the explanation. 

Finally, lay down some NOTES for this repo:

**(1) Update Frequency:** Whenever the mood strikes, aim for at least one research tutorial fortnightly. But if I'm drowning in submission deadlines, updates might take a rain check. 

**(2) Tutorial Content:** My research is mainly about time series anomaly detection, but I also dip into the time series pool for stocks, crimes, and more. Papers get the nod based on importance (including the old-school ones), state-of-art ideas, and their relevance to my current research.

**(3) Reader Interaction:** I'll drop an update note and refresh the content table every time I jazz up this repo with fresh research tutorials. Feel free to ask questions, have discussions, and recommend new papers by creating an issue.
